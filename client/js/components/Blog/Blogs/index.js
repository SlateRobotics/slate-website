    body: '## 42\n\nWhat is the answer to the ultimate question of Life, The Universe, and Everything? 42! [[?]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) The answer is meaningless, because you haven\'t asked the right question. The meaning of life is found in the questions, it seems. Not the answers.\n\n<img style="max-width:100%;" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.olenrambow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Answer-to-Life-the-Universe-and-Everything.png" />\n\nQuestions like ["How to get into robotics?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/6n5np9/how_to_get_into_robotics/), ["How hard would it be to learn robotics"](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/2cy47h/how_hard_would_it_be_to_learn_robotics/), and ["Want to learn robotics, where do I start?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/77jn85/want_to_learn_robotics_where_do_i_start/) are among the most common types of questions on [r/robotics](http://reddit.com/r/robotics). Mostly, responses are nice and try to be helpful, but sometimes, the responses are negative. This is because it\'s actually a rather unproductive question.\n\nThe best questions are mission oriented and debuggable. Jon Skeet has [a great write-up](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/) for asking good questions on Stack Overflow, which is applicable here. When you ask a question about "getting into robotics", you\'ve defined a very vague mission and a non-debuggable process.\n\nHow will you know when you\'ve finally reached your goal? How can you test that things are going according to plan? My goal today is to not to set you on the path of the straight and narrow, but help you find search for that path by teaching you to frame the question properly.\n\n*Side note: you\'re not a bad person for asking these vague questions. We all start there. Most of us in robotics today saw some cool robot somewhere, and said: "I want to be involved in that!" It will just be beneficial to you if we can focus the question a little more.*\n\n## Defining an outcome\nThe problem of not having a problem can most easily be alleviated by setting a goal. When you properly define an outcome you wish to achieve, you can begin to plot backwards toward where you are today, thus outlining a series of tasks to accomplish. Mission oriented and debuggable.\n\nThis is where you must attune your chi and look inward, young grasshopper. What is driving you? Do you want to design robot hardware? Do you want to program an autonomous robot? What sort of things would you like to program?\n\nAs mentioned in my aside, most of us first become interested in robotics because we saw something cool. [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com/) has some of the coolest stuff in robotics that you\'ll ever see. [Rethink Robotics](http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/) is another great company. My early inspiration came from [Willow Garage\'s PR2](http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/pr2/overview). What was most interesting to you about the robot you saw?\n\n<iframe style="max-width:100%;width:560px;height:315px;margin:15px auto;display:block;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HMx1xW2E4Gg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nFor me, I was inspired by seeing a [video of the PR2 playing pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMx1xW2E4Gg "PR2 Robot Plays Pool"). The fact that you could program a robot to do that in just a week made me see how important it is to get as many of these types of platforms into the hands of as many engineers as possible.\n\nSo, it was the programming I was most interested in. But in order to program something, I needed a platform, which was too expensive. So, I had to build my own platform. But I needed a way to design and manufacture it. So, I got a student 3-year trial of Autodesk Inventor, a 3D printer and started designing.\n\nThis cascading series of tasks is a sign that you\'re focused on something tangible. Once you can decide on what is most interesting to you and what you want to achieve, the steps for how to get there becomes much clearer. You may not know how to do any of it, but the questions you now ask are becoming more easily google-able. Eventually you get to a question like "How do I power an Arduino with a battery?", and you find that there\'s a simple [step-by-step instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Powering-Arduino-with-a-Battery/) on that. \n\n## Conclusion\nI don\'t mind at all that people ask vague questions. It\'s part of the exploration process of learning, and it\'s important as a community of roboticists to not shun people for just being noobs. We want robotics to continue to grow and develop in the coming decades, and as a result, we need as many new people interested in the field as possible!\n\nMy goal with this post is to have people sit back and thing more clearly about what they\'re wanting to achieve and what the precise outcome is. This is a difficult thing to do at times, but often times, the most productive thing to do is actually take a step back. Hope it\'s helped.'
